The DIALS project provides an extensible framework to analyse X-ray diffraction data.
Much of this work is agnostic to the method used to obtain diffraction patterns, and can equally be applied to neutron diffraction data.
This repository provides a bridge between data obtained from the ISIS Neutron and Muon source and DIALS, converting raw output to formats that
DIALS can read and, additional post-processing for integration into other packages (e.g. Mantid).
